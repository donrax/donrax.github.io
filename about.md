I'm a Computer Vision & Deep Learning Engineer with a strong background in Research and Development. 
Here's a few poetic keywords:

Vision \| Computer Vision and Machine Vision<br/>
Learning \| Deep Learning and Machine Learning<br/>
Data \| Data Science and Data Visualization<br/>
Tools \| Python, PyTorch, C++<br/>
